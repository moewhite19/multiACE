"""Gen 1 (ACE Pro) IAP firmware flasher - library form for the web backend.

NOT a variant of ace2_ota.py: the two generations share the framing bytes
(FF AA ... FE) and the IAP idea, but nothing on the wire. A Gen 1 unit has
no OTA updater and speaks JSON-RPC; the ACE 2 speaks protobuf-style
commands 2/3/4. Same tested-images idea, separate transport, separate
allowlist, separate release gate - so nothing done to the Gen 2 path can
move the Gen 1 wire.

Protocol (reverse-engineered from V1.3.863; flasher and findings:
github.com/Godless50/ACE-PRO-v1.-NFC-UID, GPL-3.0):
  frame:   FF AA | len(u16 LE) | payload | crc16(payload) | FE
    crc16 = CRC-16/MCRF4XX (poly 0x8408, init 0xFFFF) - the same
    polynomial ace_protocol_v1.calc_crc uses, restated here so this
    module does not import a Klipper module.
  payload: JSON-RPC request     -> get_info / get_status / iap_version /
                                   iap_upgrade{size,crc,version} /
                                   iap_upgrade_finish
           or 0x55 | addr(u32 LE) | n(u8) | data[n] -> IAP data chunk
  staging base 0x08024000, 64 bytes per chunk (the unit's own limit).
  The unit resets itself after ~3.3 s without traffic, so the link is
  kept busy: the chunk stream during the write, get_status pings while
  waiting (prime / the post-finish poll).

The IAP sequence is the one the reporter's flasher runs on hardware:
  1. get_info / iap_version         - prove the link, read the version
  2. iap_upgrade{size, crc, version} - announce the image
  3. 0x55 chunks from 0x08024000     - write it (64 B, pace-limited)
  4. iap_upgrade_finish              - commit; the ACE reboots
  5. poll get_info                   - the unit must come back

HARD TRAP, in every direction: never flash through
/etc/init.d/S60klipper start|restart. That path runs the printer's own
update check and re-flashes the stock ACE firmware over a modified image.
Use this module / the web card, and a Moonraker firmware restart to bring
Klipper back. The full trap list is docs/GEN1_FLASH.md.
