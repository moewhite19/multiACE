# EXPERIMENTAL - background swap engine for a PARKED ACE head.
#
# While another head prints, a parked head is unloaded and (optionally)
# loaded with its next slot: heat -> stock cold-pull choreography
# (translated 1:1 from CONTROL_RETRACT_ACTION, executed as stall-free
# background moves) -> ACE bulk retract (device-direct, never touches the
# active device) -> bookkeeping -> feed to the toolhead sensor -> press +
# grip -> prime through the open dock. The arrival ACE_SWAP_HEAD then finds
# the head ready (or, after an abort, continues inline from a safe state).
#
# HARD REQUIREMENTS:
#   - HEAD MODE with 1:1 head<->ACE wiring: the bg ACE must not be the
#     printing head's ACE (an ACE cannot push one slot and roll back another
#     at the same time).
#   - The head's dock must be OPEN below: the cold-pull PUSHES ~60mm of
#     molten filament first and the prime purges through the dock. Enabling
#     a head for bg (ACE_BG_SET_HEAD / [ace_bg_swap] heads) is that
#     declaration.
#   - Nozzle wipe/ooze-cut do NOT happen while docked (no discard access);
#     the ARRIVAL pick-check wipes at the discard position instead
#     (ace.py BG_PICK_WIPE).
#
# Sensors: the toolhead sensor cannot verify a bg unload the tracked way (bg
# moves bypass the extruder trapq), so after the verified ACE bulk retract
# the head is marked absent through the OFFICIAL helper API
# (note_filament_present(False)) - with the head added to
# ace._runout_suppress_heads FIRST so the state flip can never fire a runout
# PAUSE mid-print. head_source is cleared through the same bookkeeping a
# verified unload uses.
#
# Commands: ACE_BG_SWAP (unload-if-loaded + load), ACE_BG_UNLOAD (unload
# only), ACE_BG_STATUS, ACE_BG_SET_HEAD, ACE_BG_MOVE (debug). Failures leave
# head_source INTACT unless the ACE retract completed (the state where
# clearing is truthful).
#
# REMOVABLE: delete this file + the [ace_bg_swap] config section; the only
# ace.py coupling is the optional _wait_bg_op lookup.

# --- background LOAD (the BG-Load v1 feature) ---
# The bowden feed runs the full padded get_load_length and is stopped by the
# TOOLHEAD SENSOR - the same stop marker as the inline load, hardware-
# agnostic (V1+V2; the insert event fires on a PARKED head).
# FA is turned ON after the feed and the GRIP phase pulls the tip from the
# sensor through the gears WITH the extruder turning + forward-assist (FA
# alone cannot push through the stationary gears). The V2 decoder span is
# logged ('bg-feed') as telemetry only - its flat-detect false-fired
# mid-bowden as a stop criterion (span 1512 of ~1970 on a snag).

# releases the ACE motor the moment the sensor fires, so the tip stands just
# ABOVE the gear nip with no press - during the grip only the spongy
# forward-assist must deliver it across the gap while the gears already
# spin; when it loses that race the gears turn EMPTY, the prime pumps air,
# and every host signal stays green (decoder=ACE-side, sensor=present,
# FA=assisting - only the pick coil disagrees). The INLINE load has the
# same seat gap but is protected by phase3 (coil verify + retry with ACE
# re-feed). The bg load has neither at load time, so it gets a built-in
# press AFTER the heat wait (a hot hotend, never cold filament into an
# unheated one): a short bounded second feed with the extruder still
# stationary, TIME-paced (short moves are time-paced, the slot status lags
# 1-2s), then terminate the command so the
# motor releases for the grip. V1 has no self-stop -> shorter bound (the
# inline V1 load blind-feeds into the head anyway, same class).

# while the stock T already carries the head across the machine (a purge
# worm on the print bed). 5mm chunks cap it
# at ~5mm / ~1.3s. Cost: every chunk pays the stealth-move scheduling gap
# (SCHEDULE_DELAY + MOVE_SETTLE = ~0.65s) -> ~+13s on a 120mm prime, hidden

# out of a full nozzle, plus INNER_FLUSH_FILAMENT does an ooze-CUTOFF +
# nozzle clean before AND after (stock fluidd.cfg:1106). The bg prime has
# none of that - part of its 80 only FILLS the melt zone (grip ends 60mm

# NOTHING with filament present. The whole edge-verify family (grip/prime
