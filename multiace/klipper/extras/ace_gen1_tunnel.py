# ace_gen1_tunnel.py - Gen-1 (ACE Pro) tag reads through the community
# firmware's RC522 tunnel. Plain helper module, imported lazily by ace.py -
# deliberately NOT a Klipper extra: no [ace_gen1_tunnel] config section
# exists, so an old config cannot hit the unknown-section halt, and a
# printer whose install predates this file gets one clear log line and the
# ordinary status-only path instead of a dead Klipper.
#
# The tunnel (Godless50/ACE-PRO-v1.-NFC-UID, docs/GEN1_TAG_TUNNEL.md in
# this repo). The community firmware (CV1.3.87x) hooks the ACE's
# `filament_recognition` handler and dispatches host-issued operations from
# its packed `index` parameter:
#
#   packed = 0x80000000 | reader<<24 | op<<16 | (a1 & 0x3F)<<8 | (a2 & 0xFF)
#
# and it MUST go on the wire in the SIGNED 32-bit form (packed - 2**32):
# the firmware parses parameters with a signed strtol, so the unsigned
# value is clamped and the operation is silently lost. Replies arrive in
# `result.code` - and a `result.code` only exists when the stub ran, which
# is also the support probe.
#
# Ops: 0 read reg (a1) | 1 write reg (a1 = reg, a2 = value)
#      2 FIFO write (a2, a1 = index) | 3 PCD command (a1 = TX bytes,
#      a2 = command, 0x0C = TRANSCEIVE) | 4 FIFO read | 5 RX bits
#      6 REQA+anticollision+SELECT (0 = card ACTIVE) | 7 acquire (hold the
#      reader, returns the saved recognition state) | 8 release (a2 = the
#      saved state). Ops 7/8 wrap a whole read session: the hold is what
#      keeps the stock recognition task from resetting the chip between
#      the commands, and the release is what leaves the unit in its normal
#      state.
#
# Antenna map (corrected - see the tunnel report, section 4): there are
# TWO reader antennas, TWO bays each. Antenna 1 covers slots 0 and 1
# (reader channels 0 and 2), antenna 2 covers slots 2 and 3 (channels 1
# and 3). The reader CHANNEL for a slot is the bit-swap 0,1,2,3 -> 0,2,1,3,
# i.e. channel = ((slot & 1) << 1) | ((slot >> 1) & 1) (slot_channel()).
# The partner slot sharing the same antenna is SLOT ^ 1; the partner
# reader CHANNEL is CHANNEL ^ 2. The tag must face the coil: there is no
# host-side motor control on a Gen-1 that could rotate a spool to look for
# it (feed/unwind are refused by the stock firmware), so a read is
# opportunistic by construction.
#
# Read sequence (tunnel-verified host order, inside ONE acquire/release):
#   acquire -> SELECT -> TXMODE |= 0x80 -> RXMODE |= 0x80 ->
#   BitFraming = 0 -> FIFO writes -> TRANSCEIVE -> RX bits -> FIFO reads
#   -> release.
# A full 16-byte reply is rx_bits == 0x80 (RxCRCEn strips the tag CRC); a
# page-0 read is pages 0..3, from which the 7-byte UID is taken with both
# ISO14443-3 BCC check bytes verified.
#
# Failure policy: every failure is "no tunnel" / "no tag" - never an error
# the user sees, never a blocking call outside the greenlet that runs it.
# Tunnel ops are ONLY ever sent when the firmware string matches the known
# tunnel builds (CV1.3.87x) AND a probe op answers through the stub; a
# stock (or older community) unit sees no tunnel traffic at all.
