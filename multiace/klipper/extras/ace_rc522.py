# ace_rc522.py - multiACE tag reading on an ACE 2 through the RC522 line
# (stage 1: read/bind). Plain helper module imported lazily by ace.py -
# deliberately NOT a Klipper extra: no [ace_rc522] config section exists,
# so an old config cannot hit the unknown-section halt, and a printer without this file just gets a
# clear "module missing" from the command instead of a dead Klipper.
#
# What stage 1 does - and what it deliberately does not:
#   The antenna is fixed in the bay and the tag rides on the spool, so a
#   stationary read usually fails (Simon-CR HW: 192 polls / 45 s on a
#   known-good tag, all FAILED). The PARK routine rotates the lane in
#   small FEED-FORWARD steps (rotates the spool toward the tag; rollback
#   winds the strand back out and UNLOADED the spool on HW) and
#   probes with a normal FILAMENT_IDENTIFY between steps until the tag
#   answers - then it sits parked in the field. On ACE2-Open firmware
#   (V1.1.3O, the Simon-CR UID patch) the identify answers for ANY tag:
#   Anycubic format with full identity (version 101), everything else
#   with the card UID as the sku (version 513 = 0x0201 sentinel). Stock
#   V1.1.31 still answers for Anycubic tags, so the routine degrades
#   gracefully there. The Anycubic result feeds the EXISTING ingest/bind
#   paths.
#   Stage 2 (raw RC522 ops, ACE2-Open only): for a foreign tag the firmware
#   identify is blind to, op 6 SELECT sees ANY ISO14443A card and we read
#   the NTAG pages directly - UID from pages 0-1, and the OpenSpool NDEF/
#   JSON from the user pages (material/color/brand), fed through the same
#   ingest as a full identity. Bambu is MIFARE (encrypted): UID via the
#   firmware sentinel only, no page decode (needs auth); read-only.
#   Snapmaker's own RFID is read by the printer's INTERNAL feeder readers,
#   NOT the ACE - out of scope here.
#
# HW choreography rules baked in (each cost Simon-CR a wrong result):
#   - Slots 0/1 and 2/3 share ONE antenna per pair. If the neighbour bay
#     holds a spool AND a tag already answers before we moved anything,
#     the read is ambiguous (could be the neighbour's tag) -> refuse with
#     instructions instead of binding the wrong spool.
#   - Search rotates the spool FORWARD (a rollback unloaded it on HW);
#     the restore reverses the same distance. No autonomous
#     preload on this firmware, so feeding forward to rotate is safe.
#   - Motor commands can be busy-rejected (code=0 FORBIDDEN): every
#     move goes through _rejected with a paced retry.
